this program will be a terminal notecard utility.

MAIN OBJECTS
1. Decks: groups of notecards that are stored within a file system in program directory
    -Each deck will be made up of cards
2. Cards: individual notecards and relivant information on each
    -char* front
    -char* back
    -int passes //amount of time user has viewed card
    -int hits   //amount of correct answers from user
    -char* thoughts //slot for user to add thoughts about card
    -bool active//if user no longer wants to see card in current rotation...


FEATURES
    -next card
    -flip card
    -take card out of rotation
        -->card to_show set to false. deck display only displays to_show == true
    -change front of card
        -->edit_front(const char* n_front) // generic setter
        ?how can we display current front and let user change specific parts of the string?
    -change back of card
        -->same as front
    -add thought to card
        -->add_thought(const char* n_thot)
    -delete card
        -->basic delete from a circularly linked list
    -diffrent deck
        ?This is far out. worry about after functioning decks
                    maybe a linked list of decks???
            -view decks
            -load deck
            -remove deck

My thoughts: this is the classic empasculation problem
Decks: view. add. remove. index access.
    Dynamic array with expansion option
Deck: iterate through. Last in first out.
   Circularly linked list queue
