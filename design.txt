    -Each deck will be made up of cards
2. Cards: individual notecards and relivant information on each
    -char* front
    -char* back
    -int passes //amount of time user has viewed card

My thoughts: this is the classic empasculation problem
Decks: view. add. remove. index access.
    Dynamic array with expansion option
Deck: iterate through. Last in first out.
   Circularly linked list queue
