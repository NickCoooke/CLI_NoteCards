## Ojbect Overview
**card**: holds the data of a specific notecard and members access

**Deck**: circularly linked list to mannage cards

**class**: dynamic array of decks 



**AGENDA**
1) merge list and deck to eliminate redundancy. rebreak into circular linked list class and derived card specific operations
2) break apart file structure: list, deck, and card should not all exist in the same 2 files, its not cute.
